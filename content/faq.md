## What is R?

R is an open source **programming software** dedicated to **manipulation**, **statistical analysis** and **visualization of data**.

R is free and open source, which contributes to:

- its continuous improvement (new features are made available every day by users), and
- the richness/reactivity of the user community.

Unlike some programs that only evolve when the company that created it releases an update, R evolves every day. Moreover, thanks to its large community and the reactivity of users, it is very likely that you will find the answer to your problem on the online forums.

## Why use R for data analysis?

Data is everywhere, and most businesses (large or small) generate a large amount of data.

As a business, it is important to analyze your data to:

- make **informed decisions**,
- identify **trends**, **relationships**, and **opportunities**, and
- maximize results.

The advantage of using a programming language such as R for data analysis is the **reproducibility** and **automation** of the results, and the ability to define new instructions yourself.

Reproducibility allows anyone to reproduce your analyses, and allows you to keep track of the steps that lead to the results. Automation increases efficiency by allowing you to run the same analyses on different data or at different times. Finally, the possibility of writing new functions yourself allows you to enrich the program and its functionalities.

## What are the advantages of following a training in R?

Learning R involves understanding the basic concepts and best practices for data analysis with R, improving programming skills, and developing the ability to visualize and communicate results.

While it is possible to learn R by taking online courses, reading books, participating in forums, and practicing with datasets, self-study has some limitations and is not always suitable for everyone.

A training has the advantages that:

- you benefit from the **expertise of the trainer** (both technical and pedagogical),
- it is adapted to the **needs and requests** of the participants,
- you are trained with the **most recent** and advanced techniques, and
- it provides a **maximum of skills in a minimum of time** (while preserving the quality of the teaching).

## Who are the R training courses for?

Trainings in R are intended for **anyone who has access to data and would like to analyze it**.

Basic programming and statistical knowledge can help, but most trainings are designed for beginners and can be taken without prior experience. Check the prerequisites on the [training catalog](/trainings/) for more details.

Note that like any programming language, it is important to continue practicing after the training to not lose your skills.

## What is the vision concerning trainings?

A training allows:

- participants to acquire skills (basic or advanced depending on the level of the training), and
- to give the necessary tools so that participants can continue to learn independently after the training.

In order for a training to be successful, I believe that it must be given by someone who is **experienced, educational and passionate**.

It goes without saying that in order to guarantee the quality of the training, it is important that the trainer is **competent** in the subject matter and that he/she knows the finer points.

It also goes without saying that the trainer must be a good **teacher**. Being an expert in the field is not enough; you must also:

- be able to pass on your knowledge,
- be at ease with public speaking,
- be able to adapt to the level of the participants,
- be humble.

Finally, a trainer must be **passionate** for two reasons. First, a passionate person is more likely to be competent because he or she will never stop learning about the subject. Secondly, he/she is more likely to make the training engaging, interactive, dynamic, and therefore easy to follow for the participants.

My PhD in statistics and the daily use of R for various projects have given me the necessary skills to ensure the quality of the training. In addition, as a teaching assistant at the university, I have learned to teach both large and small groups of students. I have also had the opportunity to teach students from a variety of academic backgrounds, which has taught me to adapt to all audiences and needs. Finally, I am passionate about the application of statistics (with and without R), which can be seen in my training sessions as I do everything to pass on this passion to the participants. The result is that the trainings are more interesting, more informative, and allow to achieve the educational and professional goals of the participants more quickly.

To ensure that this vision is met, I conduct all trainings myself and none are outsourced.

## How much does a training cost?

The cost of a training depends on:

- the length,
- the complexity, and
- the degree of adaptation to the needs of the participants.
