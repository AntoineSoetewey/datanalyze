Below a brief description of all trainings I can give.

Note that:

- **All trainings take place in person**. Remote trainings have the advantage that it is usually easier to organize. However, I like to make my trainings as interactive as possible. Moreover, based on my personal experience, I find it much easier for participants to ask questions and for me to answer them when trainings are face-to-face. For these two reasons, at the moment I do not accept to be instructor for a remote training when it is possible to do it in person.
- You are more than welcome to propose a venue (your offices for instance), as long as the necessary material (computers, projector, internet) is present.
- Slides, codes, exercises and documents presented and developed during the training will be sent to you so that you can access them whenever you want after the training.
- Although slides and exercises are written in English, I can give the training in **French or English** depending on the audience.

## Introduction to data analysis with R

### Objective

In this introductory training, we will discover the R language and learn how to implement the most common statistical analyses.

At the end of the training, you will be able to carry out statistical analyses autonomously and with your own data.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- How to install R and RStudio?
- Discovering R: panes, working environment, help guides, syntax, packages, etc.
- R objects: vectors, matrices, factors, lists, dataframes, dates and times, strings, etc.
- Data importation and exportation
- Data manipulation and management
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Inferential statistics: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, Chi-square test, test on proportions, goodness of fit test, etc.
- Regression and modeling: ANOVA, simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression
- Answer to your questions

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

This training is open to all students, researchers and professionals willing to learn how to analyze data in R.

No prior knowledge is required.

### Length

The training takes place over 3 days or 6 half days.

## Data visualization with R

### Objective

In this training, we will cover the main data visualization tools in R.

At the end of the training, you will be able to create good-looking graphs, both for exploration and communication purposes.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- How to draw the most common plots: scatter plot, boxplot, histogram, barplot, density plot, line plots, mean plot, time series, etc.
- Plots with R base graphics
- Plots with the ggplot2 package: principles and personalization
- Plots with statistical details (ggstatsplot package)
- ggplot2 charts through a drag and drop interface (esquisse package)
- Answer to your questions

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

The training is intended for anyone who wants to learn how to create impactful and elegant visual representations in R, either for reports or publications.

A basic knowledge of R is required: we expect participants to know how to import and manipulate data in R. Ideally, the participant followed the first day of this [training](/trainings/#introduction-to-data-analysis-with-r), or has an equivalent level through practice.

### Length

The training takes place over 1 day or 2 half days.

## Automated reporting using Quarto

### Objective

In this training, we will learn how to create analysis/activity reports, research and teaching documents with the R software.

At the end of the training, you will be able to automatically generate analysis reports combining R codes, results, tables, plots, interpretations, images and equations.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- Principles of R Markdown and Quarto
- Elements of a `.qmd` file
- Output formats and options
- Combining text and code
- Personalization of the final document: themes, table of contents, images, links, inline code, references, etc.
- Answer to your questions

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

This training is intended for anyone who:

- works with data,
- needs to share their work, and/or
- wants to automate and make their analysis reports dynamic.

This course assumes a basic knowledge of R programming. Ideally, participants are familiar with running R scripts involving data importation & manipulation, basic plots, descriptive statistics and statistical tests.

### Length

The training takes place over 1 day or 2 half days.

## Build and publish your website with R

### Objective

In this training, we will learn how to build and customize a website from the comfort of the RStudio IDE with R Markdown.

At the end of the training, you will be able to build and publish your website, whether it is your personal website, for your company or your lab.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- blogdown and distill packages
- Quarto for websites
- How to use GitHub for version control?
- How to deploy with Netlify?
- Hugo
- Additional resources
- Answer to your questions

The course starts with some background and theory, but primarily focuses on the practical implementation of a demo website so you can build yours afterwards.

### Target audience

This training is intended for anyone who wants to publish a website, blog, CV and/or portfolio.

No computer skills are required. However, familiarity with RStudio and R Markdown is an asset.

### Length

The training takes place over 1 day or 2 half days.

## Personalized training
