## Introduction to data analysis with R

### Objective

In this introductory training, we will discover the R language and learn how to implement the most common statistical analyses. At the end of the training, participants will be able to carry out statistical analyses autonomously and with their own data.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- How to install R and RStudio?
- Discovering R (different panes, working environment, help guides, syntax, packages, etc.)
- R objects (vectors, matrices, factors, lists, dataframes, dates and times, strings, etc.)
- Data importation and exportation
- Data manipulation and management
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Inferential statistics (Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, Chi-square test, test on proportions, goodness of fit test, etc.)
- Regression and modeling (ANOVA, simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression)

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

This training is open to all students, researchers or professionals willing to learn how to analyze data in R. Although no prior knowledge is required (as the first day of the training is aimed at discovering R), some basic knowledge in programming and statistics is beneficial.

### Length

The training takes place over 3 days.

## Data visualization with R

### Objective

In this training, we will cover the main data visualization tools in R.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- R base graphics
- ggplot2 package
- ggstatsplot package
- esquisse package

### Target audience

A basic knowledge of R is required: we expect participants to know how to import and manipulate data in R.
