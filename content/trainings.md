## Introduction to data analysis with R

### Objective

In this introductory training, we will discover the R language and learn how to implement the most common statistical analyses.

At the end of the training, you will be able to carry out statistical analyses autonomously and with your own data.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- How to install R and RStudio?
- Discovering R: panes, working environment, help guides, syntax, packages, etc.
- R objects: vectors, matrices, factors, lists, dataframes, dates and times, strings, etc.
- Data importation and exportation
- Data manipulation and management
- Descriptive statistics (uni and bivariate)
- Data visualization
- Inferential statistics: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, Chi-square test, test on proportions, goodness of fit test, etc.
- Regression and modeling: ANOVA, simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

This training is open to all students, researchers and professionals willing to learn how to analyze data in R.

Although no prior knowledge is required (as the first day of the training is aimed at discovering R), basic knowledge in programming and statistics is beneficial.

### Length

The training takes place over 3 days.

## Data visualization with R

### Objective

In this training, we will cover the main data visualization tools in R.

At the end of the training, you will be able to create good-looking graphs, both for exploration and communication purposes.

### Content

More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

- How to draw the most common plots: scatter plot, boxplot, histogram, barplot, density plot, line plots, mean plot, time series, etc.
- Plots with R base graphics
- Plots with the ggplot2 package: principles and personalization
- Plots with statistical details (ggstatsplot package)
- ggplot2 charts through a drag and drop interface (esquisse package)

The course alternates between theory and exercises.

### Target audience

The training is intended for anyone who wants to learn how to create impactful and elegant visual representations in R, either for reports or publications.

A basic knowledge of R is required: we expect participants to know how to import and manipulate data in R. Ideally, the participant followed the first day of this [training](/trainings/#introduction-to-data-analysis-with-r), or has an equivalent level through practice.

### Length

The training takes place over 1 day.
